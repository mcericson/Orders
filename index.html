        <p>The classical column is an architectural element that is impossible to ascribe it to a single architect.
                Vitruvius is the first architect to describe the classical orders—Doric, Ionian, and Corinthian—but his
                role is as a documentarian not a designer. Similarly, Alberti set out a numerical system for defining
                the base, shaft and capital of the column. In both Alberti’s and Vitruvius’s writing, there are no
                illustrations—Vitruvius’s were lost and Alberti intentionally used only text. Instead, the reader is
                left with textual descriptions in the form of proportional rules that define the shape and order of the
                column. These rules allowed the column to be designed at a variety of scales and sites, while
                maintaining a consistent set of formal relationships. The rules also prioritize shared knowledge over
                the individual designer or craftsperson, by exposing a detailed process for its reproduction. An Ionic
                column on a small temple will have twenty-four flutes defined by the carpenter’s square in the same
                manner as a larger Ionic column in a larger temple. In this instance, the design process is embedded in
                the order of operations defined in relationship to a tool, the carpenters square. Exposing the rules of
                the order not only ensures its replicability but also its potential to be transformed and reimagined.
                This semester, we will study columns and their ordering systems as a means of developing a set of shared
                tools and collaborative methods across the studio. The studio will begin with a detailed precedent
                analysis of the column and move onto the reimagining of its rules and systems to produce new Orders of
                columns and eventually building proposals derived from this initial research.
